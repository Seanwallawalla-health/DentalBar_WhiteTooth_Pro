# How long should you brush for?

Try to brush for a minute per day. Most people don't brush for a full minute, try to go for at least 30-45 seconds. It is best to do it before bed (and before breakfast if needed)

If you plan on eating or drinking, try to do it before brushing your teeth at night, unless the drink or food is still good after brushing your teeth. If not, the taste goes away after 1-2 hours
